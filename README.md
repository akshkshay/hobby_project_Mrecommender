This application provides all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, reviews, recommended movies, etc.

The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using `beautifulsoup4` and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.

## Note

Don't worry if the movie that you are looking for is not auto-suggested. Just type the movie name and click on "enter". You will be good to go even though if you made some typo errors.

## How to get the API key?

Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the `API` link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked to give a URL for the website, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your `API` sidebar once your request is approved.
